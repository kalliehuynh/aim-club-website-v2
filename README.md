# aim-club-website-v2

Club website for the Accessibility and Inclusivity in Medicine club at the University of Alberta.
Thanks An and everybody for letting me build your website! 
I'm still very new to the topic of accessibile web design especially with frameworks like React, 
so if there is anything that needs improvement please shoot me an email at kallie1@ualberta.ca!

I'm building this with keyboard navigation in mind and will add more screenreader compatibility soon!

Using:
- React (probably not the best to use for screenreader accessibility but I will try to make it work!)
- Simple NodeJs server (for handling upcoming events, will expand to include adding and 
  removing learning links, team members, and more!)
- Notion API so that users can add upcoming events through the club's shared notion

Access is love!
